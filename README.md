# SUSTech Beamer Theme

This is a LaTeX beamer theme for Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). There are 2 choices of image showing at the bottom of the slides:

- SUSTech logo

    <div align='center'>

    </div>

- SUSTech buildings

    <div align='center'>

    ![](image/2024-11-13-16-51-29.png)
    </div>

Just simply use `\usetheme{sustechlogo}` or `\usetheme{sustechbuildings}` to choose the image you like.
